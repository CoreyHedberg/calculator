## Summary

<image src="media/readme_screenshot.png">

This project really pushed forward my understanding of JavaScript. I was able to incorporate some newer features of the language, like writing my first couple of arrow functions.

I also wrote code to utilize the localStorage API for the browser by setting up memory save, recall, and clear buttons on my calculator.

Another first for me on this project was tying the keyboard events of the numbers, the four operators, and the Esc key to function as the way to clear the display.
